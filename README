Update 1.1

1. 	Output files: 
	(1) for imaging people: 	image_output.txt / text file mode
		format:  # of interaction, energy, pixel x, pixel y, depth
	(2) electron cloud output: 	electron_clouds.dat / binary mode
		format: number of points in the cloud, array of x, array of y, array of z, array of energy deposition at each point
	(3) initial parameters output: 	init_parameters.txt / text file mode
		format: initial energy, initial position(x, y, z), initial direction(x, y, z)
	(4) for the case the details of electron track won't need to be tracked:  gamma_interactions.dat / binary mode
		format: number of interaction, array of x, array of y, array of z, array of energy deposition at each point
		note: energy is assumed to be deposited at the point where gamma interacts with the detector

	These files can be output / not output by turn on/off the options in settings.ini

2.	collimators
	a collimator option is put into the program. The parameters can be set in settings.ini

3. 	physical process setting
	several physical processes can be turn on/off by change the option in setting.ini

4.	setup passive environment by the text gemometry file "g4geom.txt"
	if "enableTextGeometry" is enabled, you can setup your passive environment for your problem. The format of g4geom.txt can be found in http://geant4.cern.ch/collaboration/working_groups/geometry/docs/textgeom/textgeom.pdf.  Please make sure you at least set up the "world" in g4geom.txt before enable the option "enableTextGeometry"
	You will need Geant4.9.2 to run this feature!

5. 	anode pixel size can be specified by user. Do remember to change this value if you change the detector size and want imaging output!

 	please turn off the option "displayTrackDetails" when you run the problem, otherwise too many output message will be given out
